## Food donation (restaurant, supermarket, catering, bakery, delicatessen, etc.)

Brazil's current sanitary and health policies made very hard for food donation and we want to use blockchain to bind to actors that now are not engaging to each other.

In our view, NGOs will provide QR codes to people facing food vulnerability, who will collect meals from previously registered donors. When the NGO issues a QR code, it receives an NFT ERC-721 and accumulates in its wallet.

Each donated meal avoids food waste, reducing the amount of solid waste. Also, and most importantly, keeps one from feeling hungry.

QR Codes will have their validation on-chain and generate ERC-20 tokens (rewards) which could be accumulated by the donors. Those tokens can be used as deductions for income taxes, with values calculated by the average of the current price of the consumer price index among foods.

NFTs accumulated by donors can be used in two ways:
1. Social recognition for being a sustainable company, in the form of collectible awards (badges);
2. Commercializing to other companies that do not have a sustainable development agenda and want to compensate for their impact.

## Skin in the gameðŸ«€with glass walls

Use case for NGOs so it's possible to better control and also give full disclosure of their ledger books.
